# DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) // C++

A DFA is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols, by running through a state sequence uniquely determined by the string.

More details about DFA machine: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton).

The program transforms the input states into a machine and then verifies a list of words to determie the input is acceptable or not. The input for the program looks like this [Input File](dfa_lfa/lfa_in).

The output says yes for accepted words by the automaton and not for unaccepted ones. THe output looks like this: [Output File](dfa_lfa/lfa_out).
